# MikroTik Security Hardening (for your home network)

Welcome to the **MikroTik Security Hardening** repository. This project provides a curated collection of **commands**, **scripts**, and **configuration tips** to help secure MikroTik RouterOS devices against unauthorized access, misconfigurations, and common attack vectors.

## 🔐 Purpose

MikroTik routers are powerful but can be vulnerable if misconfigured. This repository aims to:
- Help home network administrators (not corporate!)
- Reduce the attack surface of RouterOS devices
- Encourage best practices for MikroTik security
- Provide reusable scripts for automating hardening tasks

## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Philosophy

> **This is an opinionated collection based on real-world experience.**  
> The hardening techniques and scripts provided here reflect the author's own practices in securing MikroTik routers in various environments. While some choices are supported by MikroTik documentation and security principles, others are based on practical lessons and risk assessments.  

Always validate and adapt configurations to suit your specific needs, network architecture, and threat model.
